## Test Day

# What I want to do
 - I want to make a Game/Interactive Experience (2.5D plateformer)
 - Night Animals/Insects are attracted to light(Moon). 
 - But they can't join the moon because there are too many artificial lights 

 ## Basically
 - You play the "moon" trying to escape the devils insects by turning ON every artificial lights you see.

## How do I prototype with Unity?
- Photogrammetry scanning: Lights Sources, environnements, elements
- Trying to find the right atmosphere I want to show: Changing scans, how do I use lights ?

## Goal for TestDay
- Proposing 3 different visual direction where the player can move around.
